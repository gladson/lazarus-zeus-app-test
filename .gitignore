# It can make harm to an existing project source. Read explanations below.
#
# Resource files are binaries containing manifest, project icon and version info.
# They can not be viewed as text or compared by diff-tools. Consider replacing them with .rc files.
#*.res
# Type library file (binary). In old Delphi versions it should be stored.
# Since Delphi 2009 it is produced from .ridl file and can safely be ignored.
#*.tlb
# Diagram Portfolio file. Used by the diagram editor up to Delphi 7.
# Uncomment this if you are not using diagrams or use newer Delphi version.
#*.ddp
# Visual LiveBindings file. Added in Delphi XE2.
# Uncomment this if you are not using LiveBindings Designer.
#*.vlb
# Deployment Manager configuration file for your project. Added in Delphi XE2.
# Uncomment this if it is not mobile development and you do not use remote debug feature.
#*.deployproj
